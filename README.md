# Annual-project
When you open the app for the first time, it asks you whether you want to lose weight, gain muscles or just stay fit, then it asks what gender you are, then it asks your weight, then your height.
Then it asks you what equippment you have (e.g. a jump rope). Then it asks you how generally strong you are, e.g. how many push ups/squats you can do.
Then, if you chose to gain muscles, it asks you which type of musles you want to gain: abs, legs, arms, or some combination of those three and how intense your workouts should be (for example on the scale from 1 to 10).
If you chose to stay fit, it also asks you how intense you want your workouts to be.
If you chose to lose weight, it asks you what's your goal, how many kilograms/pounds you want to lose monthly.
After you set up initial information about yourself, the app calculates how many days a week you should work out and the routine of your work outs and immidiately proposes you to start working out.
A window, in which the exercise you will have to do is located, pops up. A human doing that excercise might be in that window.
You can press the button to start working out. 
Then it is either going to be an excercise which, in orer to end, you have to press the button on your own (e.g. push ups, squats) or an excercise which will automatically finish after the timer runs up. The phone starts beeping then, and you have to press the button to move on to the next excercise.
Then there is a rest timer between excercises which lasts for some time, and then the cycle basically repeats, except for the fact that you don't need to press the button at the start.
After you are done with your work out, the app praises you in some way (like "Good job, you did well"), and it switches to the basic mode, where you can see your weekly progress and your overall progress.
Your progress will be represented in the form of two boxes.
In the first one, there will be information "You worked out X days out of Y nedded" followed up by something like "good job" if X>=Y or "don't stop" if X<Y.
In the second one, there will be information "You are at X weeks streak currently! Don't stop!" where X is, obviously, the amount of weeks in a row you finished the needed amount of workouts a week.
You can also press a big button "start working out" which will start the next workout.
You can also press the button to exit this work out cycle, which will firstly ask you whether you really want to exit and completely delete this workout, and When you press yes the app will basically act like it is the first time you opened it.
